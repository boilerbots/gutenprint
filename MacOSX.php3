 Gimp-Print 5.0.0-beta2 is the latest beta release in the new 5.0 series. 
 This release represents the state-of-the-art in current Gimp-Print development, but it is currently only beta quality software. As such, while it contains many new and exciting features over the 4.2.x series, it may also provide unexpected behavior.  Mac OS X Jaguar users need ESP GhostScript for full support. ESP Ghostscript is not required for users running Mac OS X "Panther" or later.

 Project Notes
 </h3>
 <p>
 Gimp-Print is available in source code form under the GPL (GNU General Public
 License). You are entitled to download the source code.
 Gimp-print on Mac OS X would not be possible without <a href=
 "http://www.cups.org/" >CUPS</a>, the open-source print spooler built-in to
 Mac OS X starting with version 10.2 (Jaguar).
 </p>
 <p>
 Gimp-Print should not be confused with GIMP, the open-source GNU Image
 Manipulation Program. Gimp-Print originated as the print facility for GIMP,
 hence the name, but has since matured into an independent printing package.
 Installing GIMP is NOT required.
 </p>
 <p>
 Gimp-Print 4.2.7 is expected to be the ultimate release in the Gimp-Print
 4.2 series unless any critical bugs are found in 4.2.7 or Gimp-Print 5.0 is further
delayed. All new development is focused on the 5.0 series.

 Gimp-Print  5.0.0-beta1 is the first beta release in the 5.x series. The changes between 5.0.0-beta1 and 5.0.0-alpha1 are too numerous to list here, so please see the <a href="https://sourceforge.net/project/shownotes.php?release_id=248831">release notes</a> for more information.
</p><p>

Please note that as of 5.0.0-beta1 the behavior of the Mac OS X installer has changed.
The installer will now permit Gimp-Print 4.2.x and Gimp-Print 5.0 to be installed simultaneously, so that printer queues may be created using either driver.
If you do not wish to retain your existing installation of Gimp-Print 4.2.x simply click on the <strong>Customize</strong> button available on the last screen of the installer and check the box for &quot;Gimp-Print 4.2.x Uninstaller&quot;
</p><p>
Please also note that this release of the installer will update any existing 4.2.x printer queue for use with 5.0. If you wish to continue using Gimp-Print 4.2.x after installing 5.0 you will need to manually create a new printer queue, or use Print Center/Printer Setup Utility to change the driver. If you would like to comment on this installer behavior please send a polite note to the Gimp-Print developer mailing list!

 Gimp-Print version 4.2.7 contains the following improvements over
 <a href= "MacOSX.php3#4.2.6">Gimp-Print 4.2.6</a>:
 </p>
<b> New Functionality:</b>
 <ol>
   <li>The Epson Stylus Photo R200/R210 and R300/R310 printers, and the
     RX500 and RX600 multi-function devices, are now supported.  These
     printers have been properly tuned and are fully functional
     (except for direct printing to CD's).  The Epson CX5300 and
     CX5400 multi-functional devices are also now supported as
     printers.</li>
   <li>The HP LaserJet 1012 and Brother HL-1440 printers are now
     supported.</li>
   <li>Super A0 and Super B0 paper sizes are now supported.</li>
   <li>Translations for Hungarian, Ukrainian, and Norwegian/Bokmaal have
     been added.  In addition, other translations have been updated.</li>
 </ol>
<b>Major bugs fixed :</b>
 <ol>

   <li>Many Macintosh OS X users have reported problems of various kinds
     with USB-attached printers, including both native USB and
     parallel printers connected with USB-parallel printers.  Symptoms
     reported include failure to print altogether, inability to print
     more than one page without rebooting or restarting the print
     system, and poor performance.  These problems are not specific to
     Gimp-Print.<br><br>

     We have released a replacement USB backend driver for Macintosh
     OS X 10.2 and higher that to the best of our knowledge fixes all
     of these problems.  This driver, named "usbtb", is available on
     the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=1537&package_id=120183">project download site</a> and more information about usbtb is available <a href="http://www.buymelunch.org/printing/usbtb/">here</a>.
     We recommend that all users of OS X 10.2 and above who are having
     printing problems with USB-attached printers try this driver.  In
     addition to resolving these problems, this driver also also
     provides textual cues to the system printer queue window to walk
     the user through recovery from common error conditions, and it
     also provides ink level reporting for Epson and HP printers that
     support it.<br><br>

     This replacement USB backend driver is not specific to
     Gimp-Print, and may be used with any USB-connected printer with
     any CUPS printer driver under OS X.</li>
   <li>(bug 907765) The CUPS driver now reports pages starting from page
     1 rather than page 0 as was previously the case.</li>
   <li>(bug 919224) The Postscript output driver (in the GIMP plugin)
     now functions correctly in non-US locales when a PPD file is
     provided.</li>
   <li>(bug 919225) A segmentation violation on the IA64 platform is
     fixed.</li>
   <li>(bug 972014) A bug in the Postscript output driver causes the
     GIMP plugin to crash on startup with certain PPD files.  This bug
     is not related to locale.  At least certain PPD files from the
     Epson PIPS drivers are known to result in this problem.</li>
   <li>(bug 919226) The horizontal printing position on the Epson Stylus
     C63/C64 and C83/C84 printers has been fixed.</li>
   <li>(bug 613054) The CUPS driver now handles, via a workaround,
     incorrect Postscript generated by some programs.  In certain
     cases, these programs result in the generation of single bit
     output, rather than 8-bit output as it should.  The result was
     that Gimp-Print printed only a thin band of horizontally
     compressed output, and it may have crashed in some cases.<br><br>The programs most commonly affected were Adobe InDesign 2.0 and
     psnup.</li>
   <li>(bug 924862) The package now operates correctly with on Solaris
     and other systems using an external libintl.</li>
   <li>(bug 929227) Gimp-Print no longer attempts to build (and fail)
     the Print plugin against the GIMP 2.0.  This fix requires a
     special build procedure in some circumstances; please see item
     (10) under Exceptions and Workarounds below.</li>
   <li>(bug 855685) escputil now reports ink levels from all known Epson
     Stylus printers.  In addition, ink level reporting is more
     reliable in general, with fewer timeouts or unparseable output.</li>
   <li>(bug 971832) The HP DesignJet 2500 and 3500 now support correct
     maximum page widths of 36" and 54" respectively, rather than 44"
     for both.</li>
   <li>(bug 971833) The PPD files now use the recommended manufacturer
     names.  Previously, certain CUPS applications could display the
     manufacturer names incorrectly.</li>

 Gimp-Print version 4.2.6 contains the following improvements over
 <a href= "MacOSX.php3#4.2.5">Gimp-Print 4.2.5</a>:
 </p>
<b> New Functionality:</b>
 <ol>
   <li>A number of newer Epson Stylus printers and multi-function devices
     are supported.  Please see the supported printers list at the
     bottom of this file for full information on supported printers.</li>

   <li>The Canon S200 is now supported.</li>

   <li>The European 10x15 cm and US Engineering C paper sizes have been
     added.</li>

   <li>The CUPS driver now offers normal and reversed paper order,
     permitting printing documents in the correct page order on inkjet
     and some laser printers.</li>
   <li>A Czech language translation has been added.</li>

 </ol>
<b>Quality Improvements:</b>
 <ol>

   <li>Under OS X, the options are grouped more appropriately, making for
     easier use.</li>

   <li>Some Epson printer resolution names have been changed for clarity.
     This change does not introduce an incompatibility.</li>

   <li>The escputil command no longer hangs if the printer does not respond (this utility is currently non-functional on OS X).</li>

   <li>Minor speed improvement for the HP LaserJet IIP.</li>

   <li>Minor adjustment to the HP DeskJet 340 margins.</li>

   <li>The PPD files have been audited for conformance to the PPD
     specification.</li>
 </ol>
<b>Exceptions and Workarounds:</b>
 <ol>

   <li>There are longstanding reports of problems printing with certain
     USB-parallel adapters on Macintosh OS X.  In particular, many
     users have reported problems with the Keyspan adapter; we
     recommend that users having problems try different brands of
     adapters, and avoid using USB hubs.  Please check our
     web site (http://gimp-print.sourceforge.net/MacOSX.php3) for a
     link to a user feedback forum regarding these cables.</li>

   <li>Mac OS X users who use the Epson Printer Utility (provided by
     Epson with their standard driver set) to check ink levels and
     perform maintenance tasks, such as head cleaning or head
     alignment, may encounter print job failures when attempting to
     print with the Gimp-Print driver after using the Epson
     utility. The cause for this failure is currently unknown, but the
     workaround is to completely power-cycle the printer, after which
     the Gimp-Print driver should again print normally.  Another
     option is to disable the Epson Printer Utility.</li>

   <li>The Mac OS X print dialog may offer an "Autoselect" option as the
     default media source (input slot) on some printers.  This option
     may not be valid and can result in nothing being printed.  The
     workaround is to choose a different setting (explicitly select
     the input slot you wish to use).</li>

   <li>The new HP DesignJets have not been fully tuned.  In particular,
     there are reports that they print too light.  This can be
     corrected with the Density adjustment (try 1.5~1.7 or
     thereabouts).</li>

   <li>The list of compatible and potentially compatible Hewlett-Packard
     printers has been updated with the latest available information.
     If a particular printer does not work with the recommended
     driver, we recommend that you try other similar drivers, check
     the Feature Requests at
     http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?atid=101537&group_id=1537&func=browse,
     and if the printer is not listed please file a feature request
     (via the Submit New button).</li>

   <li>Borderless (full-bleed) printing is not quite correct on the
     Epson Stylus Photo printers that support it (see bug 621668).
     Typically, the left or right margin is off by 1 mm or less,
     resulting in a very fine white strip on that edge.</li>

   <li>Many Canon printers do not print correctly at 720x360 DPI.  The
     workaround is to use 360 or 720 DPI.</li>

   <li>Many new Epson Stylus printers do not return status to the
     escputil command (for ink level check, etc).  We recommend use of
     the mtink tool (please see http://xwtools.automatix.de) for this
     purpose.</li>

   <li>With certain versions of CUPS and in certain configurations, if a
     new version of Gimp-Print is installed over an existing version
     genppd will create PPD files based on the older version of
     Gimp-Print rather than the newer version. </li>

While Gimp-Print 5.0 is not finalized, it contains many improvements
and changes from <a href= "MacOSX.php3#4.2.6">Gimp-Print 4.2</a>, as follows:
 </p>
<b>Major User-Visible Changes:</b>
 <ol>
   <li>In general, Gimp-Print 5.0 is not compatible with Gimp-Print 4.2.
     Gimp-Print 5.0 offers many new options (which are described
     separately below), and many options that are present in both 4.2
     and 5.0 function differently in the two releases.  In addition,
     the API is different.  Finally, the color correction is quite
     different, and profiles created against the 4.2 driver will not
     function well against the 5.0 driver.</li>

   <li>In addition to all of the printers supported in 4.2, a variety of
     Olympus and Sony photo printers are supported in this release.</li>

   <li>Options in the CUPS driver and GIMP plugin are now grouped
     according to function.  This work is still in progress, and
     further usability improvements are expected.</li>

   <li>Simplified bundles of settings are now offered for users who do
     not need to customize the settings.  The Print Quality and Image
     Type controls offer a variety of settings optimized for common
     printing tasks.  Both controls offer Manual Control settings for
     users who wish greater control over the output.</li>

   <li>Many of the color settings have changed effect.  We recommend
     starting with no color correction and making appropriate changes
     only as required.  Specific changes that you should be aware of
     include:
<br><br>

     * The default operation of the contrast setting has changed to be
       more in accord with standard practice.  In 4.2, reducing the
       contrast resulted in changing the black and white setting.  In
       5.0, reducing the contrast does not change the black and white
       settings.  As a result, it is possible to use the contrast
       setting to improve highlight and shadow detail by reducing the
       contrast.

       The old behavior is available by turning on the "Linear
       Contrast Adjustment".
<br><br>

     * The Cyan, Magenta, and Yellow settings have been replaced with
       separate settings for gamma and density for Cyan, Magenta,
       Yellow, and Black.  The Cyan, Magenta, and Yellow settings in
       Gimp-Print 4.2 most closely correspond to the gamma settings in
       5.0.

       The per-channel density settings do not affect the color
       correction.  They are applied after the color correction to
       scale the individual channels.</li>

 </ol>
<b> New Functionality:</b>
 <ol>
   <li>This release offers a new curve data type.</li>

   <li>This release offers many new output controls:</li>
   <ul>
     <li>Balance (density) controls for each channel, in addition to the
       gamma controls present in 4.2.</li>
     <li>Black (GCR) transition, including the transition gamma and the
       upper and lower limits.</li>
     <li>Transitions for photo (light cyan and light magenta) inks.</li>
     <li>Transfer curves for each channel (cyan, magenta, yellow, black,
       and composite), allowing very precise control over the output.</li>
     <li>Hue, saturation, and luminosity transfer curves.</li>
     <li>Ink limit control.</li>
     <li>The density control now permits setting density as high as 8.0,
       vs. 2.0 in 4.2.</li>

   </ul>

   <li>The Epson driver offers (almost) true full bleed for printers
     that support it (but see the limitations below).</li>

   <li>The resolution list for Epson printers has been simplified; many
     redundant resolutions have been removed.</li>

   <li>Print head directional for Epson printers (unidirectional
     vs. bidirectional) is now a separate control.  In addition to
     contributing to the simplification of the Epson printer
     resolutions, this permits the choice of unidirectional
     vs. bidirectional at all resolutions.</li>

   <li>The Epson driver now offers a choice of print head weave
     patterns.  In addition to simplifying the resolution choices for
     Epson Stylus Pro printers, this offers an additional control for
     fine tuning output quality.</li>

   <li>The Epson driver offers an Ink Set control for printers taking
     different choices of inks (such as the Epson Stylus Photo 2200,
     which offers a choice of Matte Black and Photo Black inks).</li>

   <li>The Epson driver permits adjusting the dot size if required to
     increase the amount of ink printed.  For example, if 1440x720 DPI
     is selected, but the density requested is very high, the printer
     will switch to using drop sizes appropriate for 720 DPI.  This
     option is disabled by default.</li>

   <li>Where practical, all controls offer a default setting for
     simplicity of operation.  This default value is intended to offer
     the optimal choice given the printer and its other settings.  For
     example, if "Automatic" is selected for print head direction, the
     print head motion will be unidirectional at high resolutions
     (since unidirectional usually produces better output), but
     bidirectional at low resolutions (for faster printing).

     The default is only offered for options that are not directly
     controlled by the user's action.  For example, there is no
     default choice offered for paper type, since the correct value is
     based on the paper type loaded by the user.  Similarly, there is
     no default for the input slot or ink set.</li>

   <li>A new Threshold color correction mode has been added, that
     produces either all-on or all-off of each color.  This is similar
     to the Monochrome mode in 4.2, except that it works for color as
     well as black.</li>

 </ol>
<b>Quality Improvements:</b>
 <ol>
   <li>Color and tonal accuracy is greatly improved compared to 4.2
     while the gamut (range of printable colors) has been increased.
     This particularly improves the hue accuracy of red, magenta, and
     blue, and the tonal accuracy of cyan and green.  Most Epson
     printers have been fully tuned for the new color correction
     algorithms introduced for this release.</li>

   <li>The handling of variable drop sizes and photo inks (6 and 7 color
     printers) has been completely rewritten, with the result being
     that variable drop size printers with photo inks (such as most
     Epson Stylus Photo and Stylus Pro printers) give much more
     consistent results with fewer artifacts.  In particular, colors
     match correctly across all resolutions, which was not the case in
     4.2.
<br><br>

     In 4.2, variable size drops and light inks were treated the same
     way; an "effective drop size" based on the relative size of the
     drops and the darkness of the inks was used to decide what kind
     of drop to print.  While this method has some advantages (it
     ensures that dark and light inks are never printed at the same
     place, and also that dark dots are optimally dispersed among
     light dots), it has some serious disadvantages as well: the
     properties of a small dark dot and a large light dot are not
     really the same, particularly when inks are mixed.  The
     combination of different drop sizes being used at different
     resolutions meant that the transition between light and dark inks
     differed depending upon the resolution chosen, and if more than
     one drop size was required at a given resolution, the transition
     tended to be quite marked.
<br><br>

     The new method of handling variable size drops and light inks is
     to first separate each of the four channels (cyan, magenta,
     yellow, and black) into the appropriate light and dark inks, if
     needed.  This separation is performed based on the relative
     darkness of the different ink sub-colors (such as light and dark
     cyan) and specific characteristics of the printer, ink type, and
     paper chosen.  Following this, each sub-color is screened
     separately, and the appropriate combination of drop sizes is
     chosen.
<br><br>

     The drop size selection in this release has also been changed to
     fill the page with as many small drops as possible before
     switching to larger drops.  This ensures that the largest number
     of the smallest possible drops is printed, which yields a
     smoother texture in the midtones.
<br><br>

     Finally, new dither algorithms described below allow drops of ink
     of different colors to be dispersed, avoiding clumping or
     overprinting of drops.</li>

   <li>The EvenTone dither algorithm has been extensively reworked in
     this release, offering many improvements.
<br><br>

     First, it has been rewritten to work correctly with variable drop
     size and photo printers.  This algorithm, which offers
     significant improvements over the standard Adaptive Hybrid
     algorithm, does not work optimally with variable drop sizes or
     photo printers in 4.2.
<br><br>

     Secondly, several variations on this algorithm have been
     introduced, yielding a family of high quality screening
     algorithms for different applications.  The first variation is
     called Hybrid EvenTone.  This dither algorithm perturbs the dot
     positions slightly to break up some patterning seen in standard
     EvenTone dithering in solid regions of pale tones, particularly
     when printing with black ink only.  This very slightly reduces
     the smoothness of texture in exchange for largely eliminating
     this undesirable patterning.  This algorithm is also expected to
     be more resistant to microbanding effects.
<br><br>

     The second variation is called UniTone.  This dither algorithm
     calculates the placement of all dots (except for yellow) using a
     single EvenTone pass, not just all of the dots of one color.
     This technique improves the quality when multiple inks must be
     mixed, such as when color inks are used to produce gray.  It does
     so by ensuring that all dots are equally spaced.  Typically when
     printing neutral tones with EvenTone dithering the cyan, magenta,
     and yellow dots are positioned very close to each other, even
     though the individual cyan dots are well-positioned.  This causes
     the groups of dots to appear to be single, large dots.  UniTone
     dithering evens out the spacing between all dots, producing a
     smoother texture.  UniTone dithering only functions when printing
     in color (or grayscale with multi-tone gray ink); when printing
     with black ink only, it is exactly equivalent to EvenTone
     dithering.  UniTone dithering is generally slower than EvenTone.
<br><br>

     UniTone dithering works best at improving output when the drops
     are already very small, which is usually at high resolutions.
     With these small drops, the eye has difficulty distinguishing the
     color of the individual drops, so their color tends to be
     distinguished primarily by their darkness.  While cyan ink is
     lighter than black ink and magenta ink is lighter than cyan ink,
     these differences are not overwhelming and hence the eye does not
     perceive a difference between them.  With large drops, the eye
     perceives the color of the individual drops, and small spots
     dominated by one ink become apparent.
<br><br>

     As noted above, UniTone dithers yellow separately.  This is
     because the yellow ink is much lighter than any other ink, and
     the positions occupied by yellow drops appear as holes, reducing
     the quality of the print.  Even light cyan and light magenta inks
     appear to be significantly darker than yellow.
<br><br>

     Experiments conducted to date suggest that UniTone works very
     well on the printers such as the Epson Stylus C80 at high
     resolutions, when the printer is using 3 picolitre drops.  On the
     Stylus Photo EX, at 1440x720 DPI, using 8 picolitre drops,
     quality is improved significantly when printing in normal 6-color
     mode but quality is slightly worse in 4-color mode, as the colors
     of the drops are apparent.  At 720 DPI (using 12 picolitre
     drops), quality is improved in 6-color mode but degraded
     significantly in 4-color mode.
<br><br>

     Finally, a Hybrid UniTone dither algorithm is provided, combining
     the principles of both of the above.
<br><br>

     As noted above, UniTone dithering does not always work better
     than EvenTone, although in most cases all of these algorithms
     work much better than Adaptive Hybrid in 4.2.  We suggest that
     users requiring the highest quality experiment, using Hybrid
     EvenTone as a baseline.</li>

   <li>The conversion between black and composite (CMY) gray has been
     improved in this release, yielding more neutral grays on most
     printers.</li>

   <li>Epson printers have been completely retuned, in most cases
     yielding much better density, more accurate gray scale, and
     higher Dmax on all paper types.</li>

 </ol>
<b> Architectural Changes:</b>
 <ol>

   <li>A modular architecture for family drivers.  A "family driver" is
     a collection of printer drivers for one group of printers sharing
     a common programming architecture, e. g. ESC/P2, PCL, Lexmark,
     Canon.</li>
   <li>A modular architecture for color processing.  This architecture
     will enable us, or others, to provide color management without
     having to change the internal interfaces within Gimp-Print.</li>
   <li>New composite data types.  Gimp-Print 5.0 defines additional data
     types.  These types include:</li>
   <ul>
   <li>Sequences, curves, and arrays.  A sequence is a primitive
       vector of numbers data type; curves and arrays provide
       additional capabilities such as interpolation (for curves) and
       multiple dimensions (for arrays).</li>
   <li>Lists are a general ordered container of named objects of
       arbitrary type.  They are used throughout the core library, but
       are not presently exported as such, although derived types
       are.  The creator of a list can specify constructor,
       destructor, name comparison, copy, and sort operations on list
       members.</li>
   <li>Parameters, which are part of the options system described
       below.  In addition to storing values and descriptions of the
       parameter, parameters can be queried to determine defaults and
       constraints.  Parameter lists (which use the list container
       internally) are also defined as part of this.</li>
   <li>String lists are used in various ways; in particular, they are
       used by the parameter system to inform programs of the
       available choices of values for string-valued parameters.</li>
   </ul>
   <li>Complete overhaul of the options system.  Rather than offering a
     fixed set of operations, family drivers, color modules, etc. can
     now offer a wide variety of options using a predefined set of
     data types.  The data types currently supported are strings
     picked from a list, floating point numbers, integers, curves,
     arrays, Boolean values, and filenames.
<br><br>
     The new options system provides a flexible way for drivers to
     inform applications of default values and UI hints, the ability
     to selectively enable and disable options, and a generalized way
     of verifying legality of option choices.</li>
   <li>The coordinate system has been changed from bottom left to top
     left of the page, and the printable area can now extend beyond
     the edge of the page.  The result is a more intuitive coordinate
     system for driver writers that matches the coordinate system of
     printers, and the ability to do true full bleed.</li>
   <li>Complete overhaul of the black generation in CMYK output.  Black
     generation is now performed in the color code rather than the
     dither code.  This simplifies the dither code, puts the CMYK
     generation where it should be, and improves overall flexibility.</li>
   <li>Complete overhaul of the multi-tone (photo or quadtone) ink
     processing architecture (channels).  Instead of being processed
     as part of the dithering code as in 4.2, where ink drops of
     lighter inks were assigned virtual values proportional to their
     darkness as well as their size, this is now processed after the
     initial color conversion.  This has a number of major advantages:</li>
   <ul>
   <li>As the actual amount of ink to be printed is visible to the
       color code, the color code can do ink limiting without fear
       that the dither code will change the amount of ink to be
       printed.</li>
   <li>It ensures that the same proportions of inks will be printed at
       any density and resolution.  In 4.2, the ramp from light to
       dark ink varied depending upon the dot sizes available and
       hence the resolution.  This has already been demonstrated to
       yield much better linearity and much more neutral gray scale
       with even very modest tuning effort.</li>
   <li>It enables use of all drop sizes of all ink tones.  In 4.2, we
       could not use the smallest drop size of dark ink, because the
       virtual dot size of a small dot of dark ink is typically close
       to the virtual dot size of a large dot of small ink.  This
       would yield very sharp transition, and perhaps even result in
       more light ink printed in darker regions than in lighter
       regions.  With channel processing separate from dithering, this
       concern no longer exists; we can safely use small drops of dark
       ink, improving smoothness.</li>
   <li>It enables the color code to do ink limiting intelligently
       without concern that the dither code will rearrange things
       behind its back.</li>
   <li>It greatly simplifies the specification of inks.  With drop
       size and darkness orthogonal, family drivers can greatly
       simplify their tables of inks.</li>
   <li>Dither algorithms can choose to ignore smaller drop sizes if
       they wish to offer fast operation.</li>
   <li>Applications with special requirements can now access the raw
       ink channels directly.  This facility was used to create a
       mechanism to more accurately tune printer inks.</li>
   </ul>
   <li>Use of true XML to store data about printers and paper sizes, and
     to represent new data types (sequences, curves, and arrays).
     This uses the "mxml" XML library, a fast, lightweight XML parser
     written by Mike Sweet for this project.  Currently, the use of
     XML (as opposed to compiled-in data) is limited, but we expect
     that this will change beyond the initial 5.0 release.</li>
   <li>In addition to parameters, internal components such as family
     drivers, color drivers, etc. can store arbitrary data in the
     basic stp_vars_t object.  This facility is used to simplify the
     internal driver API; the family driver no longer needs to keep
     track of dither, color, etc. information itself.</li>
   <li>The Epson Stylus family driver has been decomposed into more
     functionally distinct units.  The data schema has been
     considerably improved, and the code itself broken into more
     easily maintained units.</li>
   <li>The build system has been updated with a more contemporary
     toolchain based on autoconf 2.5 and gettext 0.11.</li>
   <li>The Print plugin for the GIMP has been decomposed into a UI
     library and the core plugin.  The user interface library is a
     pure GTK1-based library; the tiny GIMP plugin is a client of this
     library.</li>
   <li>Printer characteristics are exposed to the application level as
     read-only parameters.  This permits the escputil utility to not
     duplicate information stored in the printer driver.</li>
   <li>The CUPS PPD files now offer both fine and coarse adjustments for
     all color controls, permitting much finer control over output (in
     steps of .005 rather than .05).</li>
   <li>The CUPS driver refuses to function with PPD files created for a
     different version of Gimp-Print, providing an error message
     indicating the problem.  This avoids problems caused by
     mismatches between the PPD files and the driver.  While
     mismatches are potentially not harmful in all cases, they could
     cause problems ranging from failures to print with poor
     diagnostic messages to incorrect results.</li>
   <li>The Gimp-Print 5.0 CUPS driver can be installed concurrently with
     the 4.2 driver.  Both the PPD files and the driver carry
     different names from their 4.2 counterparts, permitting a gradual
     switchover between 4.2 and 5.0-based releases.</li>
 </ol>
<b> Exceptions and Workarounds:</b>
 <ol>
   <li>Full bleed mode does not work completely correctly on most Epson
     printers at present.  Typically there is a small margin at the
     bottom of the page (1-2 mm) and possibly a very small margin at
     the top.  However, it works correctly along the left and right
     margins.  We do not have an estimated time for a fix.</li>
   <li>Printing to CD probably does not work correctly on the Epson
     Stylus Photo 900 and the Stylus Photo R300, although for
     different reasons.  On the Stylus Photo 900, the positioning is
     most likely incorrect, while there have been reports that the
     manual feed tray is not selected correctly on the Stylus Photo
     R300.  We do not have an estimated time for a fix.</li>
   <li>The Canon, Hewlett-Packard, and Lexmark drivers do not offer all
     of the additional options and improvements that the Epson driver
     does.  We do not have an estimated time for fix.  Please contact
     us if you would like to assist with this.</li>
   <li>Translation to other languages other than US-English is not
     supported in this release.  This will be fixed prior to 5.0.</li>
   <li>The Foomatic printer data management system is not completely
     supported in this release, as noted above.  This will be fixed
     prior to 5.0.</li>
   <li>Support for the Canon S200 has not yet been ported forward from
     4.2.</li>
   <li>This release is probably slower than 4.2 in many cases,
     particularly when using High Accuracy (which is the default color
     correction in most cases) or Bright color correction.  It is
     possible that this release will not be able to drive some
     printers at full speed, particularly if your computer has a slow
     processor.  Performance has not been analyzed or tuned at
     present.  We expect to improve the performance prior to final
     release.</li>
   <li>The user's manual and developer's guide have not been updated for
     this release.</li>
   <li>The CUPS PPD update script (cups-genppdupdate.5.0) will not
     update PPD files from 4.2 or from 4.3 prior to 4.3.21.</li>

 An uninstaller for all Mac OS X Gimp-Print installer packages is <a href=
"http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/gimp-print/gimp-print-uninstaller-1.1.dmg?download"
 >now available</a> for separate download.
 This uninstaller is included with the version 4.2.6-pre3 download package, but is available separately
 for anyone wishing to remove an earlier version of Gimp-Print. The uninstaller will remove every version of 
 Gimp-Print that has ever been released as a Mac OS X installer package by the Gimp-Print project. It will also remove the version of Gimp-Print that is included by default with Mac OS X "Panther" (10.3.0).
 It will <em>not</em> remove any version of Gimp-Print that was installed by any means <em>other</em> than an official installer package (this includes command line installs).

 Gimp-Print version 4.2.6-pre2 contains the following improvements over
 <a href= "MacOSX.php3#4.2.5">Gimp-Print 4.2.5</a>:
 </p>
<b>Major changes</b>
 <ol>
   <li>A bug in the CUPS driver whereby the quality degrades on each
   successive page of a multi-page job has been fixed.  This bug was
   introduced in 4.2.6-pre1, and is not present in 4.2.5.</li>
   <li>The CUPS driver now offers normal and reversed paper order,
   permitting printing documents in the correct order on inkjet
   printers.</li>
   <li>The Postscript driver in the GIMP plug-in now works correctly in
   non-US locales.</li>
   <li>Preliminary support for the Epson Stylus C83 and C84.</li>
   <li>Preliminary support for the Canon S200.</li>
   <li>A Czech language translation has been added.</li>
   <li>The printer compatibility list has been updated to reflect the
   latest information from linuxprinting.org.</li>
   <li>Engineering C paper size is now added.</li>
   <li>escputil will no longer hang if the printer does not respond.</li>
   <li>The Swedish and German translations have been updated.</li>
   <li>The man pages have been updated.</li>
   <li>On Mac OS X when using the provided installer package the PPDs are
    now stored in the standard PPD location
   <pre>/Library/Printers/PPDs/Contents/Resources/en.lproj</pre>
   rather than in
   <pre>/usr/share/cups/model/C</pre>
   which is different from all previous releases. This change was
    made for performance reasons (memory usage).  As a consequence,
    the PPDs will no longer be available for printer setup when
    using the CUPS web admin. The Apple provided Print Center application
    is not affected by this change.</li>

Gimp-Print 4.3.18 is the latest Mac OS X release in the developmental line (4.3.x) of Gimp-Print. Currently, the 4.3.x line is not entirely functional in Mac OS X Jaguar. Almost all users should continue to use the 4.2.x line until the current issues with 4.3.x are resolved. Additionally, if you ever installed 4.3.17 and you can answer "yes" to both of the following questions:

 <ol>
<li>Have you ever previously installed an earlier version of Gimp-Print?</li>
<li>Did you run the Gimp-Print Uninstaller before running the 4.3.17 installer?</li>
 </ol>
<p> then you should either delete all of your Gimp-Print printers in Print Center, or manually update the PPD files to the currently installed version of Gimp-Print, or run the new unistaller avaialable here (soon) before reverting to any other version of Gimp-Print.

 Gimp-Print version 4.2.5 contains the following improvements over
 <a href= "MacOSX.php3#4.2.4">Gimp-Print 4.2.4</a>:
 </p>
<b>Major Improvements</b>
 <ol>
   <li>The Epson Stylus Photo 950/960/PM-950C and 2100/2200 are now tuned.
   The 950 and 960 are fully tuned, while the 2100 and 2200 are fully
   tuned with Photographic Black ink.  Matte Black ink on the
   2100/2200, and dark yellow ink on the PM-950C, are not tuned at
   this point.<br><br>
   As a special note, all of these printers print especially fast at
   360 DPI in Four Color Standard mode (in color, grayscale, and
   monochrome).  For this reason, we recommend use of Four Color
   Standard for printing text and low-resolution graphics on plain
   paper with these printers.</li>
   <li>Epson Stylus Photo printers with an automatic paper cutter option
   (the Stylus Photo 925, 950/960/PM-950C, and 2100/2200) now enable
   the cutter.  This has received some testing, but has not been
   tested comprehensively.</li>
   <li>The Epson Stylus Pro 5000 should now print correctly, although this
   is not yet tested.</li>
   <li>The Epson Stylus Color 640 now prints properly in grayscale and
   monochrome at 720 DPI and above.</li>
   <li>DESTDIR now works with 'make install' in the Gimp plugin
   directory (this is generally of interest only to packagers).</li>
   <li>The user manual should now install correctly on all platforms.</li>
   <li>The version of libtool used to build this release has been changed
   to 1.4.3.  This enables the packaged source to compile correctly on
   a few architectures (this is generally of interest only to
   packagers).</li>
   <li>Updates to the Debian packaging (this is of interest only to Debian
   packagers).</li>
   <li>The Mac OS X installer package now automatically updates the PPD file
   for every existing Gimp-Print printer (queue) in Print Center.</li>
 </ol>
<b>Exceptions and Workarounds:</b>
 <ol>
   <li>
     There have been a number of reports that printing to a
     Windows-hosted printer from Macintosh OS X results in only the
     first page of the job being printed (see bugs 668342 and
     672692).  In at least some cases, connecting the printer directly
     to the Macintosh results in correct prints.  There is no known
     workaround short of connecting the printer directly to the
     Macintosh.  Investigation is continuing on this problem.
   </li><li>
     There are longstanding reports of problems printing with certain
     USB-parallel adapters on Macintosh OS X.  In particular, many
     users have reported problems with the Keyspan adapter; we
     recommend that users having problems try different brands of
     adapters, and avoid using USB hubs.  Please check our
     web site (http://gimp-print.sourceforge.net/MacOSX.php3) for a
     link to a user feedback forum regarding these cables.
   </li><li>
     Mac OS X users who use the Epson Printer Utility (provided by
     Epson with their standard driver set) to check ink levels and
     perform maintenance tasks, such as head cleaning or head
     alignment, may encounter print job failures when attempting to
     print with the Gimp-Print driver after using the Epson
     utility. The cause for this failure is currently unknown, but the
     workaround is to completely power-cycle the printer, after which
     the Gimp-Print driver should again print normally.  Another
     option is to disable the Epson Printer Utility.
   </li><li>
     The Mac OS X print dialog may offer an "Autoselect" option as the
     default media source (input slot) on some printers.  This option
     may not be valid and can result in nothing being printed.  The
     workaround is to choose a different setting (explicitly select
     the input slot you wish to use).
   </li><li>
     The new HP DesignJet drivers have not been fully tuned.  In particular,
     there are reports that they print too light.  This can be
     corrected with the Density adjustment (try 1.5~1.7 or
     thereabouts).
   </li><li>
     The list of compatible and potentially compatible Hewlett-Packard
     printers has been updated with the latest available information.
     If a particular printer does not work with the recommended
     driver, we recommend that you try other similar drivers, check
     the Feature Requests at
     http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?atid=101537&group_id=1537&func=browse,
     and if the printer is not listed please file a feature request
     (via the Submit New button).
   </li><li>
     Borderless (full-bleed) printing is not quite correct on the
     Epson Stylus Photo printers that support it (see bug 621668).
     Typically, the left or right margin is off by 1 mm or less,
     resulting in a very fine white strip on that edge.  This will not
     be fixed in 4.2; it is expected to be fixed in 4.3 and beyond.
     There is no workaround other than trimming the page.
   </li><li>
     Many Canon printers do not print correctly at 720x360 DPI.  The
     workaround is to use 360 or 720 DPI.
   </li>

 <p>
 Gimp-Print version 4.2.4 is the newest final release build in the stable
 4.2 series; it contains the following improvements over <a href=
 "MacOSX.php3#4.2.3">Gimp-Print 4.2.3</a>:
 </p>
<b>Major Improvements</b>
 <ul>
   <li> (bugs 603702 and 619537) All PCL laser printers (including HP
     LaserJet and many other printer lines) printed too light (black
     came out as medium gray).</li>
   <li> (bugs 631993 and 633910) Various problems with the PPD files
     used by the native CUPS driver worked incorrectly with many
     applications, leading to failures to print, failures to recognize
     certain page sizes, and custom page sizes not working correctly
     have been fixed.  To fix these problems, you must reinstall all
     of your printer queues using Gimp-Print PPD files.  To do this,
     you must delete and re-create the printer queue (merely modifying
     or configuring the queue will not solve the problem).
     Please see the release notes for 4.2.3 (below) for instructions
     on using custom page sizes.</li>
   <li> (bug 628698) Lexmark printers produced severely distorted colors
     in some cases.</li>
   <li> (bug 631498) Canon large-format printers did not support A3 paper
     size; these printers are now capable of printing on that size
     paper.</li>
   <li> (no bug number) PCL laser printers now have correct margins on
     A4-size paper.</li>
   <li> (bug 630365) The Epson Stylus Photo 950 now prints correctly in
     1440x1440 and 2880x720 DPI modes.  This is not significant new
     functionality; these modes are actually printed at 2880x1440,
     which did not have this problem.</li>
   <li> (no bug number, but related to 628698) 6-color HP printers should
     now print correctly using all 6 colors.</li>
   <li> (no bug number) The dimensions for 22x30 watercolor paper were
     incorrect.</li>
 </ul>
<b>New Functionality</b>:
 <ul>
 <li> The following HP DesignJet large-format plotters are now
     supported: DesignJet 230, 250, 430, 450, 455, 488, 700, 2500, and
     3500.  Other DesignJet printers may work with one of these
     drivers.</li>
 <li> The following Epson multi-function devices are now supported as
     printers: Stylus 3200CX and 5200CX.  This project does not
     support scanners, so we cannot offer any advice on the scanner
     component of these units.</li>
 <li> The Epson MJ-930C is now supported.</li>
 <li> Various manual pages have been added or updated.  See
     gimpprint(3), ijsgimpprint(1), escputil(1), and cups-calibrate(8)
     for more information.</li>
 <li> Transverse versions of the US CAD standard paper sizes (ArchA,
     ArchB, ArchC, ArchD, and ArchE) have been added.  This permits
     printing e. g. ArchD size (24x36) plots on 36 inch wide paper.</li>
 </ul>
<b>Exceptions and Workarounds</b>:
 <ul>
 <li> The new HP DesignJets have not been fully tuned.  In particular,
     there are reports that they print too light.  This can be
     corrected with the Density adjustment (try 1.5~1.7 or
     thereabouts).</li>
 <li> The version of libtool used to build this package, 1.4.2, does
     not create shared libraries correctly on some platforms (in
     particular, MIPS and MIPSEL).  The workaround is to either build
     static libraries only (configure --disable-shared), or to
     regenerate the libtool with libtool 1.4.3.  We expect this to be
     fixed in a future release.</li>
 <li> The Epson Stylus 2200 has not been tuned in 7-color mode, and
     reports are that quality is subpar in this mode.  We recommend
     using 6-color mode until this is tuned, which we hope to be in
     the near future.</li>
 <li> There are longstanding reports of problems printing with certain
     USB-parallel and USB-serial adapters on Macintosh OS X.  In
     particular, many users have reported problems with the Keyspan
     adapter; we recommend that users having problems try different
     brands of adapters, and avoid using USB hubs.  Please check our
     web site (http://gimp-print.sourceforge.net) for updates.</li>
 <li> The list of compatible and potentially compatible Hewlett-Packard
     printers has been updated with the latest available information. If a
     particular printer does not work with the recommended
     driver, we recommend that you try other similar drivers, check the

 <h3>
 The History of Gimp-Print
 </h3>
 <p>
 This package was first written by Michael Sweet of <a href=
 "http://www.easysw.com" >Easy Software Products</a>. In the summer of 1999, I
 (Robert Krawitz) purchased an <a href= "http://www.epson.com" >Epson Stylus
 Photo EX</a> printer to feed my photography hobby. Finding no existing
 drivers, I adapted Mike's Print plugin to the six-color printer, and by the
 end of the year released 3.0, which went into the Gimp 1.1. The intention was
 for this to be the stable plugin in the Gimp 1.2, while development of the
 Print plugin continued for later release.
 </p>
 <p>
 I put the 3.1 development tree on <a href= "http://sourceforge.net"
 >SourceForge</a>, and quickly found a group of like-minded people who wanted
 to print high quality output on inexpensive inkjet printers. One of the main
 goals, which wasn't expected to be met until late in the 3.1 cycle, was to
 write a Ghostscript driver so that printing wouldn't be restricted to the
 Gimp. Imagine my surprise when Henryk "Buggs" Richter wrote one within days!
 </p>
 <p>
 In July 2000, not more than a year after I bought the EX, I was honored to be
 invited to the Linux Printing Summit hosted by VA Linux Systems. In
 preparation for that, I spent long hours printing out test images. I went
 back to the last 3.0.9 release, which seemed like such an advance at the
 time. I was floored at how far we'd come in four months! Output that I had
 been impressed with using six colors was put to shame by four color output,
 so that should give you an idea what six color and variable dot size printers
 can do. Just goes to show what a group of committed people can do.
 </p>
 <p>
 I came away from the Summit with lots of new ideas, and in November 2000 we
 released Gimp-Print 4.0, the culmination of 9 months of work by the team. The
 quality was already tremendously improved over what we could do at the
 Printing Summit.
 </p>
 <p>
 We started serious work on 4.1 in December, 2000. Despite the fact that 4.2
 is a "minor" release over 4.0, there are vast improvements: the driver is
 built as a shared library, making it much easier to write higher layer
 software to, the packaging system follows GNU standards, the print quality
 (in particular, color accuracy, a well-known weakness in 4.0) is even better,
 performance is better, there are more options, and more printers supported. <a
 href= "http://www.linuxplanet.com/linuxplanet/opinions/3689/1/" >This article
 in LinuxPlanet</a> is one user's take on it.
 <p>
 We're not done. We're going to start work on 4.3, which will become 5.0. We
 hope to implement proper color management, improved dithering, and improve
 the performance (which is another known weak point, although there are a lot
 of tradeoffs between performance and quality that you can choose from).
 Meanwhile, we're not abandoning 4.2: we're fixing bugs, adding support for
 new printers, and porting selected features back from 4.3.
 </p>
 <p>
 We think you'll really enjoy using gimp-print!
