 What is Gimp-Print for Jaguar and Darwin? Why would I want to install it?
 </h3>
 <p>
 Gimp-Print is a package of high quality printer drivers for Mac OS X
 Jaguar, Darwin, Linux, BSD, Solaris, IRIX, and other UNIX-alike
 operating systems. In many cases, these drivers rival or exceed the OEM
 drivers in quality and functionality. Our goal is to produce the highest
 possible output quality from all supported printers. To that end, we have
 done extensive work on screening algorithms, color generation, and
 printer feature utilization. We are continuing our work in all of these
 areas to produce ever higher quality results, particularly on the
 ubiquitous, inexpensive inkjet printers that are nonetheless capable of
 nearly photographic output quality. Additionally, Gimp-Print provides
 excellent drivers for many printers that are otherwise unsupported on
 Mac OS X.

 Mac OS X Panther (10.3.x) but whenever I include EPS files I get really
 low quality output. This did not happen on Mac OS X Jaguar (10.2.x). Did
 the the printing behavior change between Mac OS 10.2 and Mac OS 10.3? How
 can I get the high quality output in Panther?
 </h3>
 <p>
Yes, printing behavior changed between 10.2 and 10.3, and more so for a certain class of applications that use the so-called 'deprecated printing path,' which means that Apple has discouraged application developers from creating programs that print in this manner. Within this class, the quality and type of printed output generated by the application is dependent on whether the system describes the printer as a raster device or a PostScript device. Your application seems to be a member of this class.
</p><p>
In Mac OS 10.2, the system <b>always</b> describes any printer driven by Gimp-Print as a PostScript device. Technically, this behavior is a 'bug' and it requires that a PostScript interpreter (such as ESP Ghostscript) be available to CUPS (the underlying print spooler) to enable the Gimp-Print driver (or any CUPS raster driver) to print from this class of application.
</p><p>
In Mac OS 10.3, by default the system <b>always</b> describes any printer driven by Gimp-Print as a raster device, which is technically correct. The reason why your printed EPS files look 'jaggedy' in 10.3 has to do with the quality of raster generated by your application (it turns out that the 'bug' in Jaguar was actually a 'feature' for most end users!). You can force Panther to emulate the 'buggy' behavior of Jaguar by setting a specific 'system default'. Here is the procedure to do that:</p>
<ol>
<li> Quit your application, if it is running</li>
<li> open the Terminal application found in /Applications/Utilities/</li>
<li> copy the following command in its entirety and paste it into the Terminal window, then press the return key:</li>
</ol>
<pre>

defaults write -g com.apple.print.apple.pictwpstopdf YES
</pre>
<p>
This setting is permanent, and it affects all applications on your system. If you later decide that you prefer the default behavior then issue this command instead:
<pre>

defaults write -g com.apple.print.apple.pictwpstopdf NO
</pre>
<b>Note:</b> Although you may set the default in Panther to force certain applications to produce PostScript rather than raster, you will never need to install ESP Ghostscript in Panther for use with Gimp-Print because the operating system includes software that performs PostScript to raster conversion. Other printer drivers may still require ESP Ghostscript, but installing it in Panther will have no effect on Gimp-Print.

 I am trying to install Gimp-Print on Mac OS X Panther (10.3.x) but when I get

 red exclamation mark and I cannot install it.
 </h3>
 <p>
 There is an apparent bug in the Panther Installer that prevents the installer
 from running over "newer" releases. So if you are trying to install 4.2.6 and
 you have ever installed 4.3.x or 5.0alpha then this bug may bite you. This bug
 is not present in Jaguar; the workaround in Panther is to run the Gimp-Print
 uninstaller and remove any other versions of Gimp-Print.
<br><br>
 Please note that when you run the uninstaller you will most likely want to click <b>Customize</b> and skip the <b>Gimp-Print printer remover</b> option, which you accomplish by removing the check from the box. If you skip this option your current Gimp-Print printers will be preserved, which is likely what you want. Otherwise, your printers will be removed and you may need to go through the <a href="p_FAQ_OS_X.php3#usbSetup">secret option-click-elbow process</a> again to recreate them.

 4.2.5 so where did they go?
 </h3>
 <p>Starting with version 4.2.6-pre2 of the Mac OS X installer package the
 Gimp-Print PPDs are installed into the "standard" location recommended by Apple,
 <pre>/Library/Printers/PPDs/Contents/Resources/en.lproj</pre>
 rather than in the CUPS-standard location of 
 <pre>/usr/share/cups/model/C</pre>
 which is different from all previous releases. This change was
 implemented primarily for performance reasons, but it also provides a means for
 normal users to find a PPD if need be (the previous PPD path is hidden from users
 in the Mac OS X Finder).  As a consequence of this change,
 the Gimp-Print PPDs will no longer be available for printer setup when
 using the CUPS web admin; the Apple provided Print Center application
 is not affected by this change. If you want or need to use the CUPS web
 admin to create a printer (if you need to create a serial printer, for example)
 you can still use the CUPS web admin to create the printer, but you will need to
 select one of the available models and then open Print Center/Printer Setup Utility 
 and change the driver to the correct Gimp-Print model (select the printer in the list, choose "Show info..." and select the correct model).

 Printing does not work from "Carbon" applications (Adobe Photoshop, Acrobat,
 Appleworks, etc...), but I can print from "Cocoa" applications (Preview,
 TextEdit, etc...) just fine. How can I fix this ?
 </h3>
 <p>
 The Gimp-Print drivers for OS X are CUPS plugin filters. In Mac OS 10.2
 and 10.2.1 when users print with CUPS-based drivers from a "Carbon"
 application the application generates PostScript output instead of the
 OS X native PDF (this is not the case with vendor-supplied printer
 drivers). If <a href=
 "http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=18073&release_id=109322"
 >ESP Ghostscript</a> is not installed the print job simply fails
 without indication (other than the lack of a print!). If you haven't 
 installed ESP Ghostscript just download the <a href=
 "http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/espgs/espgs-7.05.5-0.ppc.dmg?download"
 >Mac OS X installer</a> and run it.
 </p>
 <a name="tellMeMore"></a>
 <li><h3>
 I want to know more about the new printing system in Mac OS X Jaguar. How do
 the various components like CUPS, Gimp-Print, Ghostscript, etc... interact?
 </h3>
 <p>
 The best place to start is with the CUPS documentation. In particular, the <a
 href= "http://www.cups.org/overview.html" >CUPS overview</a> will help you
 understand how the filters are chained together. You'll find more filter
 information <a href= "http://www.cups.org/sdd.html#3_7" >here</a>.
 </p><p>
 When printing, CUPS tries to string together a series of tools in order to
 convert the submitted file to the format needed by a printer. In OS X the
 files submitted are generally either PDF or PICT files with embedded
 PostScript. When printing to a gimp-print driver, if the input file format is
 PDF then the OS X PDF to raster filter is run and the raster data handed to
 the gimp-print driver. If instead the input file format is PICT with
 PostScript, then the OS X PICT to PostScript filter is run. In order to get
 from PostScript to raster, the ESP GhostScript filter is run next in the chain
 and then the raster data is handed to the gimp-printer.
 </p><p>
 So you have the following two chains:
 </p>
 <pre>
 PDF file -> cgpdftoraster filter -> rastertoprinter filter -> printer

 PICTwPS -> pictwpstops filter -> pstoraster (GhostScript) filter ->
 rastertoprinter filter -> printer
 </pre> 
 </p><p>
 The application determines which of these two paths are invoked. Most OS X
 applications submit a PDF for printing. Certain PostScript centric programs
 such as Adobe applications cause the second filter chain to run.

  I'm trying to set up TCP/IP printing for my Epson 1520 (900N, etc...) with
 type-B ethernet card. HELP!!!
 </h3>
  <p>  
  The Epson type-B ethernet card is a curious thing. Typically you can
 generate a page describing the printer's network interface settings if you
 press and release the small black button on the back of the printer's network
 card; you need to use a Mac OS 9 (or Windows) application to configure the
 card's TCP/IP settings.  Epson shipped <a href=
 "http://support.epson.com/hardware/printer/option/c8232a/index.html"
 >multiple</a> <a href=
 "http://support.epson.com/hardware/printer/option/c8233a/index.html"
 >models</a> of this card and the particular <a href=
 "ftp://ftp.epson.com/drivers/MNET2102.SEA.hqx">configuration</a> <a href=
 "ftp://ftp.epson.com/drivers/EpsonNet_MacAssist.SEA.hqx" >application</a>
 that you need will depend upon which <a href=
 "http://support.epson.com/cgi/find_product.pl?product=epson+net&amp;tab=index.html&amp;x=0&amp;y=0"
 >model of card</a> you own. You can use the configuration
 applications to set the printer's IP address, default gateway (router), and
 subnet mask. If you are on a managed network (such as in an office or school)
 then you need to get the proper settings from the network administrator.  If
 it's just your Mac, your printer, and you then you can follow these
 guidelines: for simple networks (non-routed) the network interfaces for the
 printer and computer need unique addresses on the same network (subnet). You
 can achieve this by using TCP/IP settings for your printer that are very
 similar to those of your Mac. <b>System Preferences/Network</b> will show you
 your Mac's settings. Here's an example:</p><pre>
  Mac network settings                    Printer network settings
       IP Address: 192.168.0.100                   IP Address: 192.168.0.95
      Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0                  Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0
           Router: 192.168.0.1                Default gateway: 192.168.0.1
 </pre>
 <p>It would be prudent to open <b>/Applications/Utilities/Network Utility</b>
 and Ping the new address before you assign it to your printer, just to make
 sure that the address is not already in use. Start the ping and wait; after a
 brief delay you should get </p><pre>ping: sendto: Host is down</pre><p> which
 indicates that the address is probably available. Set the Epson with the new
 TCP/IP settings and run Ping again to the same address. This time you should
 get an almost immediate response:</p> 
 
 <pre>PING 192.168.0.95 (192.168.0.95): 56 data bytes 
 64 bytes from 192.168.0.95: icmp_seq=0 ttl=64 time=3.304 ms 
 </pre>
 <p>If you don't get a response from Ping you won't be able to print; go back and
 try a different IP Address.
 As soon as you can ping the printer from your Mac go to page 3 of <em>How
 to Print with Gimp-Print</em> (or the set up section in this FAQ) and follow
 the instructions for TCP/IP setup.

 <li><h3>
 How can I print using FireWire (IEEE 1394)?
 </h3>
 <p>
 In a nutshell, you can't. Not yet.  CUPS uses "backends" to transfer the driver code to the printer. On Mac OS X Gimp-Print uses CUPS and since there is not yet a FireWire backend available for Mac OS X you can't print with Gimp-Print over Firewire.  You <em>can</em> print to a printer that has a FireWire port, you simply need to use a <em>different</em> port, such as the USB port, an ethernet port, or the parallel port via a converter.
 </p>
  <a name="pap"></a>
 <li><h3>
 How can I print using AppleTalk?
 </h3>
 <p>
To set up Appletalk (PAP) printing you first need to open the terminal and type "atlookup" at the command line. After a delay you should get a (possibly long) list of appletalk devices on your network. You want to find the entry for your printer and use that info to form a PAP URI that you will enter in Print Center when you set up the printer.
</p><p>
When you type "atlookup" it should look something like this:
</p><pre>

	macosx% atlookup 
	Found 2 entries in zone *
	ff00.2f.80      Stylus PHOTO EX:EPSONLQ2
	ff5f.39.80      imac:Darwin
</pre><p>
For this example, here is the corresponding pap URI that you would enter in "Device URI" for device (pap) using the Print Center "Advanced" setup:
</p><pre>

	pap://*/Stylus%20PHOTO%20EX/EPSONLQ2
</pre><p>
Note that the colon is replaced with a forward slash and any spaces in any names must be replaced with "%20" in the URI.
Here it is more generically:
</p><pre>
	pap://zone/Appletalk_Device_Name/protocol
</pre>

 I am having trouble printing with a certain brand of USB-to-parallel converter cable. Which cable brands are supported on Mac OS X?
 </h3>
 <p>  
While the Gimp-Print drivers are not partial about any particular brand or model
of USB-to-parallel converter cable, when used with Mac OS X certain brands of 
cable appear to work better than others. Some cables which work fine in Mac OS 9
(such as the Keyspan USB-to-parallel cable) reportedly do not work at all in Mac
OS X. If you are researching the purchase of a USB-to-parallel converter, or if 
you are experiencing printing problems while using a USB-to-parallel cable with
an otherwise-supported printer please check with the cable manufacturer to 
confirm that the cable is supported on Mac OS X. Additionally, there is a 
<a href="https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&atid=351537&aid=644565&gro
up_id=1537"
>user feedback forum</a> dedicated to this subject where many Gimp-Print OS X 
users have entered compatibility reports for a wide variety of cable brands and 
models. If you have experience using a particular brand and model of cable 
please consider helping out your fellow users by adding your report to the 
<a href="https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&atid=351537&aid=644565&group_id=1537" >list</a>.

 How can I print correctly from Adobe InDesign using Gimp-Print?
 </h3>
 <p>  
The InDesign application uses a somewhat non-standard printing procedure. The 
 following workaround procedure may help you achieve the desired printer output:
 <dl>
 <dd> Select <b>Print...</b> from the <b>File</b> menu, or press <em>command-P</em>.
 <dd>Within the InDesign print dialog, click the <b>Printer...</b> button (*not* the blue flashing <b>Print</b> button!)
 <dd>Dismiss any warning dialog by clicking <b>OK</b>
 <dd>Set any Gimp-Print driver features under the <b>Printer Features</b> popup item.
 <dd>Click <b>Print</b> in the system print dialog (you will return to the InDesign
  print dialog).
 <dd>Click <b>Print</b> in the InDesign dialog.
 </dl>
 <br>
 This procedure may be necessary for each document you wish to print. On subsequent
 prints of the same document the regular "Print" button should work as expected.
 </p>
 <a name="HPUSB"></a>
 <li><h3>
 My multi-function HP Device is not printing over the USB port. What's wrong?
 </h3>
 <p>  
 Several users have reported USB compatibility issues with certain HP 
 multi-function devices. While the driver generates the correct device code to 
 produce printing, the USB connection (the Mac OS X CUPS usb "backend") may
 not be capable of communicating properly with the device.
 </p><p>
 If your device fails to print and you are reasonably sure that you set it up 
 correctly then you may be experienceing this problem. As a workaround you may 
 be able to print to your device by using an alternate connection interface 
 (but this method is not well tested). For devices with a parallel port you can
 try a <a href="https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&atid=351537&aid=644565&group_id=1537"
 >compatible USB-to-parallel cable</a>, or a parallel-port print server. 
 Devices that lack a parallel port may possibly function with a compatible USB
 print server.

 <p>  
 That driver has been fixed since the the 4.2.3 release.  You will likely get much
 better quality output if you use 4.2.5-pre1 or later, as this printer was not tuned
 before the 4.2.5 release. If you still cannot print and you are trying to print on
 roll-feed paper make sure that you have selected the "Roll Feed" option in the 
 "Paper Feed" print dialog (the "Auto Select" option is currently non-functional).

 What files are installed by the Gimp-Print installer for Jaguar and
 Darwin? Where are they installed? I want to remove them; how do I do it?
 </h3>
 <p>
 "The Gimp-Print drivers for <a href= "http://www.cups.org/" >CUPS</a>,
 and the required PPD files." That's the short answer to the first
 question. The long answer is that a lot of files are installed into the
 (typically) hidden BSD unix layer of Jaguar. You shouldn't need to
 remove Gimp-Print in order to restore your previous printing capability.
 Just delete any Gimp-Print printers that are set up in Print Center. That
 said, if you are really fired up about saving the 8.2MB of disk space you can
use a tip provided by Wil Shipley to get rid of those pesky files.
</p><p>
To remove Gimp-Print 4.2.3 open a Terminal window and type the following command 
</p>
<pre>lsbom -f -l -s /Library/Receipts/Gimp-Print-4.2.3.pkg/Contents/Archive.bom | (cd /; sudo xargs rm)</pre
<p>
 To remove version 4.2.4 of Gimp-Print use this command:
</p>
<pre>lsbom -f -l -s /Library/Receipts/Gimp-Print-4.2.4.pkg/Contents/Archive.bom | (cd /; sudo xargs rm)</pre
<p>
 To remove version 4.2.5 (and all later versions) of Gimp-Print use this command:
</p>
<pre>lsbom -f -l -s /Library/Receipts/Gimp-Print.pkg/Contents/Archive.bom | (cd /; sudo xargs rm)</pre
<p>
 You will need to enter an admin password (yours if you're the only user on
 your system) to use sudo.

 <li><h3>
 The Gimp-Print installer for Jaguar is very nice, thanks for providing
 it. But, why haven't you provided me with an easy way to remove the
 Gimp-Print files from my system?
 </h3>
 <p>
 An unistaller is under development.  Again, if you delete all of the Gimp-Print
 Printers from your Print Center "Printer List" the software will be completely
 disabled. If you simply <em>must</em> remove the files then see the answer to the preceding question.

 <li><h3>
 The list of supported printers says that PostScript Level 1 printing is
 supported, but I can't use Gimp-Print to print to my Level 1 printer
 (Laserwriter plus, Laserwriter IINT, etc...). What's wrong?
 </h3>
 <p>
 Currently, printing to level 1 printers is not supported on Jaguar.
 Generating the necessary level 1 compatible output requires a postscript
 generator, like <a href= "http://sourceforge.net/projects/espgs/" >ESP
 Ghostscript</a> and some special printing "filters". A solution to this
 problem may become available in the future.
 </p>
 <a name="version"></a>
 <li><h3>
 Which versions of Mac OS are compatible with Gimp-Print?
 </h3>
 <p>
 Gimp-Print is compatible with Mac OS X version 10.2.x (Jaguar) or later.
 It does not work with version 10.1.x or 10.0.x or any version of Mac OS 9.
 </p>
 <a name="versionX"></a>
 <li><h3>
 I have never heard of version "10.1.x" but I have 10.1.5, does
 Gimp-Print work with that?
 </h3>
 <p>
 "10.1.x" means "any" minor version of 10.1 such as 10.1.1, 10.1.2,
 ...,10.1.5. So, if you want to use Gimp-Print you should upgrade to at
 least 10.2.
 </p>
 <a name="supportedPrinters"></a>
 <li><h3>
 Is my printer supported by Gimp-Print?
 </h3>
 <p>
 There is a comprehensive <a href=
 "http://Gimp-Print.sourceforge.net/p_Supported_Printers.php3" >list of
 supported printers</a> at the Gimp-Print website. If your printer is
 listed as "Fully Operational" then you should expect excellent output
 when using Gimp-Print. Printers listed as something other than "Fully
 Operational" may still work, but not all the features of the printer
 will be available. For printers that are not listed as supported you may
 still be able to print by trying the driver for a printer that is similar
 to yours, but the results may disappoint you.
 </p>
 <a name="generalSetup"></a>
 <li><h3>
 OK, I just installed Gimp-Print on Mac OS 10.2 (or later) and I tried to

 <p>
 The Gimp-Print 4.2.2 installer package (and all later versions) contains
 an illustrated set-up guide called <em>How to Print with Gimp-Print</em> 
 located at the root level of the installer disk image. This guide will
 walk you through the printer set-up process for USB and TCP/IP printers.
 If you don't have access to this set-up guide the following instructions
 should help:
 </p>
 <p>
 Setting up printers using the Gimp-Print driver can be slightly
 different than setting up other drivers depending on how you are
 connecting to your printer.
 <ul>
 <li>
 <h4>
 Make sure your printer is supported by Gimp-Print
 </h4>
 <p>
 see question on supported printers.
 </p>
 <a name="usbSetup"></a>
 <a name="optionClickElbow"></a>
 <h4>
 <li>USB connection
 </h4>
 If your printer is supported by Gimp-Print and it is connected directly
 to your Mac with a USB cable then you should follow these steps to set
 it up:
 <ol>
 <p>
 <li>Make sure the USB cable is properly connected to both your printer
 and your Mac.
 <li>Turn on your printer.
 <li>Restart your Mac (if you know what you're doing and you know that
 you do not have any print jobs in progress you can do <tt>sudo killall
 -HUP cupsd</tt> instead of restarting)
 <li>Open the Print Center utility (located in
 <tt>/Applications/Utilities/</tt>).
 <li>Hold down the option key on your keyboard and either click on the
 "Add" button in the Print Center toolbar or select "<tt>Add
 printer...</tt>" from the "<tt>Printers</tt>" menu. A new sheet will
 open.
 <li>In the sheet click on the top popup menu and select "Advanced" from
 the very bottom of the list.
 <li>Next, click on the "<tt>Device:</tt>" popup menu and select your
 printer's name from the very bottom of the list (if you see only
 "<tt>USB Printer (usb)</tt>" and not your printer's name you need to
 restart your mac with your printer turned on and connected).
 <li>Finally, click on the "<tt>Printer Model</tt>" popup menu and select
 the manufacturer for your printer, and in the small window at the bottom
 of the sheet select the PPD file for your printer model. It's important
 that you select the correct PPD file, and the names are not overly
 descriptive, but if you match your printer model number with the number
 in the PPD file name you should be OK.
 <li> Click "<tt>Add</tt>".
 <li> Print a test page.
 </p>
 </ol>
 <a name="networkSetup"></a>
 <h4>
 <li>Network connection
 </h4>
 If your printer is supported by Gimp-Print and it is available over
 TCP/IP via a built-in network card (such as the Epson 10/100 ethernet
 type-b card available for certain printers) or an inexpensive network
 print server (parallel to ethernet converter) then you can set it up
 for IP printing:
 <p>
 <ol>
 <li>First you need to get the IP address and the print queue name for
 your printer from your network administrator. If you are the
 administrator for your network consult the documentation that came with
 your network device to learn how to determine this information (if you
 don't understand the ins and outs of TCP/IP networking you should find
 a friend who does). If you can't determine the Queue Name for your print
 server try using the default queue first. If that fails try a common
 queue name like lp (lower case LP). If you have the correct IP Address
 but you don't use the correct queue name you won't print.
 <li>Open the Print Center utility (located in
 <tt>/Applications/Utilities/</tt>).
 <li>Click on the "<tt>Add</tt>" button in the Print Center toolbar or
 select "<tt>Add printer...</tt>" from the "Printers" menu. A new sheet
 will open.
 <li>In the sheet click on the top popup menu and select "<tt>IP
 Printing</tt>".
 <li>Fill in the IP address of the printer and the queue name in the
 appropriate boxes.
 <li>Next, click on the "<tt>Printer Model</tt>" popup menu and select
 the manufacturer for your printer, and in the small window at the bottom
 of the sheet select the PPD file for your printer model. It's important
 that you select the correct PPD file, and the names are not too
 descriptive, but if you match your printer model number with the number
 in the PPD file name you should be OK.
 <li> Click "<tt>Add</tt>".
 <li> Print a test page.
 </ol>

 <h4>
 <li>Windows printer via SAMBA
 </h4>
 If you want to print to a shared printer connected to a Windows XP
 computer try these instructions (this procedure has not been thoroughly
 tested):
 <p>
 <ol>
 <li>Open the Print Center utility (located in
 <tt>/Applications/Utilities/</tt>).
 <li>Hold down the option key on your keyboard and either click on the
 <tt>Add</tt> button in the Print Center toolbar or select <tt>Add
 printer...</tt> from the <tt>Printers</tt> menu. A new sheet will open.
 <li>In the sheet click on the top popup menu and select
 <tt>Advanced</tt> from the very bottom of the list.
 <li>Next, click on the <tt>Device:</tt> popup menu and select
 <tt>Windows Printer via SAMBA</tt>.
 <li> In the <tt>Device Name:</tt> field enter a descriptive name for
 this printer.
 <li>In the <tt>Device URI:</tt> field enter the device URI in the
 following form:
 <p>
 <tt>smb://winuser:password@workgroup/server/printer </tt>
 <dl>
 <dt><tt>winuser</tt> <dd>XP login name <dt><tt>password</tt> <dd>XP

 </p>
 <li>Finally, click on the <tt>Printer Model</tt> popup menu and select
 the manufacturer for your printer, and in the small window at the bottom
 of the sheet select the PPD file for your printer model. It's important
 that you select the correct PPD file, and the names are not overly
 descriptive, but if you match your printer model number with the number
 in the PPD file name you should be OK.

 </h2>

 <ol>
 <p>
 <a name="onlyForGimp"></a>
 <li>
 <h3>
 Is it only for Gimp?
 </h3>
 <p>
 No, it can be used for many printing needs. Gimp-Print started out as a
 driver for The Gimp, the well known image manipulation program. Early in
 development versions for Ghostscript and later CUPS were added. The
 emphasis is still on quality color printing, though performance gets a
 lot of attention these days.
 </p>
 <a name="missingFiles"></a>
 <li>
 <h3>
 I cannot install it, it complains about missing Gimp files
 </h3>
 <p>
 <ul>
 <li>If you have the Gimp installed on your system, you probably have the
 user package, but not the development package, installed. You will need
 to install the latter from your installation media; it's usually named
 gimp-devel.
 <p>
 <li>If you do have the Gimp installed, and you've installed the
 gimp-devel package, you may also need to install the gtk-devel and
 glib-devel packages.
 <p>
 <li>If you've installed the Gimp from source, you may need to run
 <tt>ldconfig</tt> as root. The installation procedure for the Gimp
 doesn't run ldconfig, which is needed on many systems to tell the system
 about the shared libraries that are installed. If you don't understand
 this, don't worry; just do it. If you're nervous about doing that,
 reboot.
 <p>
 <li>If you don't have the Gimp installed on your system, and just want
 to compile Gimp-Print for CUPS (for example), you need to pass
 <tt>configure</tt> the option <tt>--with-gimp=no</tt>, so it won't try
 to look for the Gimp and fail.
 </ul>
 </p>
 <a name="imageType"></a>
 <li>
 <h3>
 What is the difference between B/W, Line art, solid color and Photo mode
 (or ImageType in Ghostscript)?
 </h3>
 <p>
 Photo mode does a lot of work to make colors as similar to screen
 presentation as possible. This takes time. Line art is faster, but
 colors may be off. Solid Colors is somewhere in between. B/W mode does
 not use color ink when printing, and is much faster.
 </p>
 <a name="noWorky"></a>
 <li>
 <h3>
 I selected my printer and it doesn't work at all!
 </h3>
 <p>
 Please check your printing system (lpd, CUPS, LPRng, etc.)
 configuration. You may also have a problem with your parallel port or
 USB connection, so take a look at <tt>/var/log/messages</tt> (or
 wherever your system logs are kept).
 </p>
 <a name="feedsPaper"></a>
 <li>
 <h3>
 I selected my printer and it simply feeds paper without printing
 </h3>
 <p>
 Many Epson printers (in particular) do this if they encounter an error
 in the command stream. This usually indicates a bug in Gimp-Print;
 please report it to <a
 mailto= "Gimp-Print-devel@sourceforge.net" >Gimp-Print-devel@
 sourceforge.net</a> or via the bug tracking system at <a
 href= "http://Gimp-Print.sourceforge.net" >http://
 Gimp-Print.sourceforge.net</a>. Make sure you report the printer you
 have and all of the settings that you used. But first, triple check that
 you're using the right printer model!
 </p>
 <a name="distortedImage"></a>
 <li>
 <h3>
 I selected my printer, and it prints the image badly distorted, or at
 completely the wrong place on the page
 </h3>
 <p>
 This usually indicates a bug in the package. Please report it as
 described above. Also as described above, make sure you've set the right
 printer.
 </p>
 <a name="printsGarbage"></a>
 <li>
 <h3>
 I selected the right printer, but garbage, or only part of the page,
 gets printed
 </h3>
 <p>
 Printers for which support just has been added may not have been tested,
 as the developers do not have access to the printer. It is worth trying
 different settings. For example, change the resolution to a mainstream
 value as used on that printer. Also photo mode is better tested than the
 optimized versions. When you find out what works and what doesn't, file a
 bug report.
 </p>
 <p>
 One common cause of this is not using "raw" mode when printing from the
 Gimp plugin. Depending upon your printing system, you will need to use
 either <tt>-l</tt> (traditional BSD lpd), <tt>-oraw</tt> (CUPS lpr), or
 <tt>-d</tt> (most versions of System V lp, including CUPS). Otherwise
 the printing system attempts to interpret the output as something else,
 and tries to apply a filter to it to convert it to something else
 (usually PostScript).
 </p>
 <p>
 Another less common cause of this (it usually causes other symptoms,
 like printing only part of a page) is lack of space somewhere. This is
 most commonly an issue when using the Gimp Print plugin. The plugin
 creates a huge temporary file that gets sent to the printing system. The
 size of the file varies; it's proportional to the page size and the
 resolution setting chosen. Full-page, high resolution photographs can
 result in 100 MB of output. The system may need to have 2 or 3 copies of
 this file for short periods of time. If your /tmp, /var, or wherever your
 spooler keeps its temporary files is too small, you'll have problems.
 </p>
 <p>
 Finally, problems with your parallel or USB port may be the cause of
 problems here. Certain Epson printers in particular are known to be very
 sensitive to the quality of connecting cables, and may have trouble with
 long or low quality cables, or USB hubs. If nothing else works, and
 you're certain you've tried everything else, try a better cable or a
 direct USB connection.

 <h3>
 What's up with the HP Deskjet 1200?
 </h3>
 <p>
 HP had sold two printers with the 1200 model designation. The old
 version is 300 DPI and has a heating element to dry the ink. It was
 manufactured around 1990. The new version is of 2000 vintage and has
 higher resolution. The one supported by this package is the new one???
 </p>
 <a name="lowRes"></a>
 <li>
 <h3>
 I selected the right printer and the quality is lousy
 </h3>
 <p>
 Try selecting a different resolution or quality setting. Especially
 lower resolutions have a problem putting enough ink on paper. Also, use
 Photo mode. If you find settings that do not work at all (you get
 garbage or no output, but other settings work), report these as bugs.
 High resolutions should produce a similar (but smoother) result than
 medium resolutions. Resolutions under a certain printer dependent figure
 are seen as draft-only - for example lower than 360 DPI on Epsons with
 standard paper or lower than 300 DPI on HP.
 </p>
 <p>
 Also make sure that you have the right kind of paper selected. Selecting
 plain paper when you're printing on high quality photo paper is certain
 to result in a light, grainy image. Selecting photo paper when you're
 printing on plain paper will result in a dark, muddy image that bleeds
 through the paper. There are differences between different kinds of
 paper; you may need to tweak the density and color settings slightly.
 </p>
 <p>
 In addition, certain printers don't work well on certain kinds of paper.
 Epson printers work well on Epson papers, but don't work well on many
 third party papers (particularly the high quality photo papers made by
 other vendors). This isn't a conspiracy to lock you into their paper,
 it's because they've formulated the paper and ink to work well together.
 </p>
 <p>
 If you use Ghostscript, make sure the Ghostscript resolution is not set
 higher than the driver resolution. If it is higher, the driver has to
 throw away part of the pixels, leading to uneven strokes in text and
 slanted lines with interruptions.

 <h3>
 I tried to test my Epson printer by 'cat .cshrc > /dev/lp0' and nothing
 prints!!!???
 </h3>
 <p>
 The classic test of printer connectivity -- sending an ASCII file to it
 -- doesn't work on many Epson printers out of the box (or after printing
 from Windows or Macintosh). Epson printers from the Stylus Color 740 and
 newer use a special "packet mode" in which they do not recognize
 standard commands or ASCII text. They must be sent a special sequence
 that takes them out of packet mode. The command
 </p>
 <p>
 <pre>escputil -u -s -r /dev/lp0</pre>
 </p>
 <p>
 will take the printer out of packet mode and enable you to print to it.
 Of course, as soon as you've read back status from the printer, you know
 it's working (although if you're unable to read status out of the
 printer, you might have a different problem; see above).
 </p>
 <p>
 Printing to your printer from Gimp-Print, whether you use the Print
 plugin, the CUPS driver, or the Ghostscript driver, will also take the
 printer out of packet mode. But then again, if you successfully print to
 your printer, you know it's working, so why worry? If you're trying to
 test your spooler, though, the escputil trick above will do it. Just
 make sure that /dev/lp0 is the right device; if it isn't, substitute
 whatever is.
 </p>
 <p>
 <em>Note:</em> this does not apply to printers prior to the 740 (such as
 the Stylus Photo EX, Stylus Color 850, or anything even older). Those
 printers are always capable of printing ASCII text, and don't have
 packet mode. You can read status from them, but you must leave off the
 '-u' option.

 <a name="BSD"></a>
 <li>
 <h3>
 My USB-connected Epson Stylus printer won't work with {Free,Net,Open}BSD!
 </h3>
 <p>
 By default, the BSD device driver for the USB printer device (usually
 ulpt0) does a prime, or USB bus reset, when the device is opened. This
 causes the printer to reset itself (one can hear the print head moving
 back and forth when this happens) and lose sync. After this the printer
 won't go into graphics mode and instead spews characters all over you
 expensive photo paper. This has been observed on the Stylus Photo 870;
 it likely exists with other USB-connected Epson Stylus printers.
 </p>
 <p>
 The fix is to use the "unlpt0" device instead of "ulpt0". The driver
 doesn't perform the USB prime when unlpt is opened. If this device
 doesn't exist on your system you can create it with
 </p>
 <p>
 <pre>mknod unlpt0 c 113 64 root wheel</pre>

 <h3>
 I try to print with StarOffice and it doesn't print correctly!
 </h3>
 <p>
 If you use CUPS, and your prints from StarOffice come out incorrectly
 (particularly at low resolution), try the following. This assumes a
 network installation of StarOffice 5.2.
 <ol>
 <p>
 <li>Ensure that <tt>root</tt> does not have a .Xpdefaults file (if it
 does, the procedure below will edit root's version rather than the
 system-wide version in <tt>.../office52/share/xp3/Xpdefaults</tt>).
 </p>
 <p>
 <li>As root, start <tt>.../office52/program/spadmin</tt>. This is the
 StarOffice printer administration program.
 </p>
 <p>
 <li>Click on <b>Install New Driver</b>. For the <b>Driver directory</b>,
 select your CUPS PPD directory. This is usually <tt>/etc/cups/ppd</tt>.
 This should list the names of all of the drivers you have installed.
 </p>
 <p>
 <li>If there are no drivers visible, you may need to give the .ppd files
 names ending in .PS. The following script will accomplish this:
 </p>
 <p>
 <pre>
 # cd /etc/cups/ppd
 # for f in * ; do
 > ln -s $f `echo $f | sed 's/ppd$/PS/'`
 > done
 </pre>
 </p>
 <p>
 Following this, restart <tt>spadmin</tt> and click on <b>Install New
 Driver</b>. When you select your CUPS PPD directory, you will find the
 necessary drivers listed.
 </p>
 <p>
 <li>Select the drivers you want StarOffice to know about and click OK.
 </p>
 <p>
 <li>If you have been using the generic Postscript printer, remove all of
 your old queues.
 </p>
 <p>
 <li>Select the appropriate new driver(s) and click <b>Add New
 Printer</b>.
 </p>
 <p>
 <li>Select the appropriate printer queue and click <b>Connect</b> to
 connect it to the printer queue of your choice.
 </ol>
 </p>
 <p>
 You can now set up appropriate options for this printer. Note that you
 can create multiple queues with different settings, for example one for
 draft mode and one for high quality.
