# XCFLAGS can be set from the command line.
# We don't include -ansi, because this gets in the way of the platform-

# XLIBDIRS is for ld and should include -L; XLIBDIR is for LD_RUN_PATH

# Newer SVR4 systems can use -R in XLIBDIRS rather than setting XLIBDIR.
# Both can be null if these files are in the default linker search path;
